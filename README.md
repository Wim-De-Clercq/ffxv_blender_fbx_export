- go into C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\scripts\addons
- extract the 'io_scene_ffxv_fbx' folder from the zip.
- restart blender if already open.
- In the user settings under the addons tab, disable the original "Import-Export: FBX format" addon, and turn on the "Import-Export: FFXV upgraded FBX format" addon.

When exporting to FBX, now a 3rd Version is available under the 'Export FBX' options in the bottom left: FFXV FBX.
